# Change Log of Document Hash Since HC4 Released

This page tracks the change of the document since we released the HC4 collection. We provide the original and the new hash of the document 
that have changed. Since the document can change multiple times in the future, we record the date that we record the changes. 
The date does not represent the actual date when the document changes but when we discover it. 

If the document you have fetched does not match either the original hash in the `id.jsonl.gz` file nor the new hash recorded here, 
please raise an issue to bring this to our attention. 

If you are interested in using the original documents, please contact us to request the original version. 
We may request signing a written consensus or agreement for proper usage if required by Common Crawl or other parties.
